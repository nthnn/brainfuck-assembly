; This example implements a simple echo program
; that reads input from the user and outputs it,
; effectively functioning as a basic "cat" command
; in Unix, which outputs its input to the standard
; output.

in          ; Get an initial input
jmp begin   ; Begin the loop
    out     ; Output the previous value
    in      ; Get another input
jmp end     ; End of loop
